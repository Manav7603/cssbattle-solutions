# CSSBattle Daily Practice 🎯

This repository contains my daily practice solutions for CSSBattle challenges.
I solve these challenges purely for fun and mastery, focusing on writing
minimal, creative, and optimized CSS.

Each solution is documented with:
- The original target reference
- My final HTML/CSS solution
- Short notes on tricks, patterns, and learnings
